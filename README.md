# Geode xapk
This file is to make me download a smaller (bytes) version of geode. In this repository I will show this file (Geode.xapk) unpacked.
# How to download it 
* Go to Google Play/Play Store
* Search for ZArchiver
* Download it
* Enable all the permissions that the app recommends
* Go to folder "Downloads"
* Find your xapk file location
* Press on this file, then press open
* When you have the tab "open with", choose zarchiver download
* Wait for the file to finish and done.
# NOTE: If the file has errors, no problem. They aren't fixable, but they will do nothing to the app.
